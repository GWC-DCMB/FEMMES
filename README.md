# FEMMES

Girls Who Code at the University of Michigan Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics is excited to host an activity at the Fall 2017 Females Excelling More in Math Engineering and Science [(FEMMES)](https://www.femmes.studentorgs.umich.edu) Capstone on Nov 11, 2017. Our activity is entitled Choreography with Code and allows students to use if statements to control a ballerina in Scratch (https://scratch.mit.edu). Here you will find instructional materials and the Scratch code. Content developed by Stephanie Theide, Brooke Wolford, Rucheng Diao, Emily Roberts, Zena Lapp, Sarah Hanks, and Marlena Duda.

## Instructional slides 
The lesson walks through booleans, conditional statements, and operators. The [PDF file](Choreography_with_Code_FEMMES_Nov_11_2017.pdf) does not have the animations that the [powerpoint file](Choreography_with_Code_FEMMES_Nov_11_2017.pptx) does.

## Scratch code
Import the .sb2 file in this repository to Scratch website following these instructions: https://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Exporting_and_Importing#Importing. You can also [access the code directly](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/184623153/).

## Handout with definitions and instructions
The [handout](FEMMES_Nov11_handout.pdf) defines the components of scratch and provides instructions to create a new if/else code block to change the ballerina's costume color. A .docx file is provided as well. The answer is in the final slide of the instructional slides.
