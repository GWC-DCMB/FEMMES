Here you will find educational resources developed by Girls Who Code at the University of Michigan Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics for Females Excelling More in Math Engineering and Science [(FEMMES)](https://www.femmes.studentorgs.umich.edu) Capstones. These materials are geared towards 4th-6th grade girls.

# FEMMES Capstone Winter 2018

Our activity is a revised version of Choreography with Code from Fall 2017. We have added a component using [Ozobot](https://ozobot.com) with content development by Marlena Duda, Zena Lapp, Alex Weber, and Brooke Wolford.

# FEMMES Capstone Fall 2017

Our activity is entitled Choreography with Code and allows students to use if statements to control a ballerina in Scratch (https://scratch.mit.edu). Content developed by Stephanie Theide, Brooke Wolford, Rucheng Diao, Emily Roberts, Zena Lapp, Sarah Hanks, and Marlena Duda.

## Instructional slides 
The lesson walks through booleans, conditional statements, and operators. The [PDF file](Choreography_with_Code_FEMMES_Nov_11_2017.pdf) does not have the animations that the [powerpoint file](Choreography_with_Code_FEMMES_Nov_11_2017.pptx) does.

## Scratch code
Import the .sb2 file in this repository to Scratch website following these instructions: https://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Exporting_and_Importing#Importing. You can also [access the code directly](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/184623153/).

## Handout with definitions and instructions
The [handout](FEMMES_Nov11_handout.pdf) defines the components of scratch and provides instructions to create a new if/else code block to change the ballerina's costume color. A .docx file is provided as well. The answer is in the final slide of the instructional slides.

# FEMMES Capstone Fall 2016 and Winter 2017
Learn about the incredible, edible cell! What’s a cell you ask? Use a microscope and examine at the many types of cells that make up your body—neurons, kidney cells, lung cells, and more! Then make your own edible cell to learn about the important components of the cell such as the famous mitochondria, the power house of the cell! Why are cells so important? They have all the instructions to make you, you and they keep your body healthy and working properly.
